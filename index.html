				<h2>Good day!</h2>
					<p>I am <b>Mark Gabriel Mataya.</b></p>
					<p><b>CMSC 11</b> is my favorite subject because it was the first subject where I experienced programming.</p>
					<p>My favorite food is <b>donut</b> because it has different flavors and all are very tasty.</p>
					<p>My favorite things to do are <b>playing basketball</b>, <b>playing computer games</b>, and <b>going out with my friends</b>.</p>
					<p>I am expecting to learn the <b>things necessary about web</b> because as of now I honestly have <b>little knowledge and skills for web development</b>. </p>
					<p>I also hope that our professor will be approachable whenever we need guidance or help.</p>
